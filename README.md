# mobile-hacker-stories

Create an app that shows me the top stories from Hacker News (use their public API).

Make sure itâ€™s easy to read on mobile. Add dark mode too, in case I want to read at night.

I donâ€™t care about everything in Hacker News, so let me add basic filters tied to specific subjects too: Engineering, Design, and Psychology.
